<h3>Questions: </h3>
<strong>1) What is class?</strong>
<strong>2) What is an instance of a class?</strong>
<strong>3) thus far we have compared the class to a blueprint. Can you think of another analogy to explain classes?</strong>

<strong>Answer 1: </strong><p>A class is a like a blueprint of a building. We can use classes to initilize or create space in memory for multiple instances (or objects) and we can use them to do things that are defined in that class. </p>
<strong>Answer 2: </strong><p>An instance of a class is like taking the core properties of an object and use them according to our wishes. We can even change its properties by making changes to code in folder which the class is stored.</p>
<strong>Answer 3: </strong><p>Another analogy that I think of would be compare it to any kind of structure. We can just take any structure and apply it on different areas. </p>
